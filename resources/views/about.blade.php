                                <p>　On October 25, 2019, Natural Humans was founded. Fast forward to January 2024, and a new chapter began with the rebranding to Nippon Sanyo Lift Associate.

                                    At Nippon Sanyo Lift Associate, we pride ourselves on offering cutting-edge products backed by the latest technologies and a team of seasoned professionals with diverse perspectives. Our aim extends beyond borders as we aspire to broaden our sales reach to encompass countries and regions beyond Japan.

                                    Our mission is clear: to contribute to the creation of a sustainable society that prioritizes safety, security, and comfort, all while delivering value from the user’s perspective. Embracing the ethos of continual improvement, we recognize the need to adapt to evolving paradigms in an era of perpetual change.

                                    Flexibility and resilience are paramount in our pursuit to be a company that swiftly responds to the dynamic landscape of business. By amalgamating our expertise, technologies, and systems across various domains, we position ourselves as a pivotal force in catalyzing customer innovation across borders and industries.

                                    United as a team, we are committed to realizing our management objectives. Our dedication extends beyond our products; we vow to uphold our commitment to customer safety and peace of mind, fostering enduring relationships within the communities we serve. </p>
